Namaste React Day 1
:>to deploy the react code, bundler is required, default if WEBPACK,creat-react-app uses WEBPACK only.
:>webpack or parcel packages hai toh we need a package manager in our project-npm - for minifer,optimise and other- basically a package manager
:>to install npm - npm init -y : (-y)-removes varios questions
:>we use npm install command to add any package.
PARCEL 
:> npm install -D parcel
:> -D means dev dependencies means we need this package in our development enviornment.
:>(^)caret- to update the packages install to their minor version. such as 2.3.2 can upgrade to 2.3.3
:>(~)tilda- to update the packages install to their minor version. in package.json
:>package.lockjson- very imp file, lock the version, never have to put to gitignore, keeps the record o
:>integrity in package-lock.json--
:>npx- excutes using npm
:> to start the app using parcel we use-- npx parcel index.html-{entry point of our app}
:>to start npx parcel index.html-post this....  advantages of PARCEL
it creates a server for you
it cleans up the code
it does minification
it does hot module Replacement.
it does dev and prod build smoothly,
it does image optimisation also as it only takes website load slow,
it has super fast build algo,
it also does caching by development for us,
it is compatible with older versions of browsers as well,
it manages port number as well by default localhost:1234,
it helps to run HTTPS on dev env also,
it has ZERO congif,
:> <script type="module" src="app.js/> mandatory to add type="module" as import and export works post this only.
:>to add react and react app we need this cmmd-
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
:>Parcel - brings live server functionality also, 
hot module reloading(HMR) and file watcher algorithm- se once you save the file automatically the changes are visible.
:>file watcher algorithm-written in C++,keeps the track of all the files in project and tells server to reload if any change is there.
:>npx parcel index.html-it creates the dev env quickly and host it to a server, whereas
npx parcel build index.html- create the files for production ready.
:>we should put parcel-cache in gitignore.
:>anything which can be generated on server push to gitignore
:>Transitive Dependencies->dependencies under dependencies.
