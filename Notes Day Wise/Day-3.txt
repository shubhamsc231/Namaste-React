Namaste React Day 3
:>whenever a div has more than 1 child in it , we must initalise key to it.---Reconcillation
:>keys improves performance of the app.
:>React.createElement()-gives us an object and this object is converted in HTML code and put in DOM.
:>JSX-Javascript XML,it is much more easier to use it as multiple react.createElement messes up the code.
-we can update the HTML using JS.
ex: const heading=<h1>Welcome</h1>
-JSX is js inside HTML,
-JSX is HTML like syntax in JS,
:>to initalise a class in jsx we use classname
:>jsx if we run in console will not work as it doesn't understand jsx,in real time BABEL converts the jsx and gives us.
:>BABEL creates a Abstract Syntax Tree(AST)-and works as compiler and line by line transforms the code.
:>JSX=>uses React.createElement()=>transforms in OBject=>HTML(DOM),
:>there is one more package-lock.json in node-modules.
REACT Component---names start with a Capital letter.
Functional COMPONENTS-
:>they are a normal js function which returns some piece of react elements.
:>when there are multiple lines in functional components then return block  must be enclosed in (); return(); 
:>we can miss return statement as well.
ex: const HeaderComponent=()=>{<div></div>}
:>when we have to call a react element in a functional components then simply call it in {},
:> we can call a functional components inside another component by {funtionname()} or <FuntionalNAme/>0;
:> we can do all js inside {} these brackets in any component.
:> JSX is very secure, it sanitises everything.
:> if we use component inside components-Component Composition.
