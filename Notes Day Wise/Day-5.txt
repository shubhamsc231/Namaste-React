 Namaste React Day 5
:>two ways of exporting the component--
export default title-it will export, it will export the component, by default.
:>only one component can be exported using default export.
ex: export default Header; --by default         export const header=()={}-by name
:>we can import export by default by simple import Header from "./component.js",--known as Default import.
:>for by name we need to write like this import {Header} from "./component.js",--known as Named Import.
:>using default export we can import using any name.
:>.js and .jsx both extensions are same only. either of one can be used.
:>whenever we export  multiple components using named export, we can import as import * as obj from ""./path;
:>congif.js and constants.js are same.
-React is fast in dom manipulation.
:>React variable - every component in react maintains a state, we declare local variable inside state in react.
:>Hooks- is just a normal function,
:>function of useState()- it is used to create state variable, we import it using named import.
useState-return as array [variablename, function to update the variable];
we destructue it to use.const [searchInput, setSearchInput] = useState("");
local state variable scope is inside its component.
why we need state variables?- whenever we want the vairables in sync with ui we use.
React watches all the state variables and whenever there is a changes in them it re-renders the component.
-whenever state vaiable changes react rerenders the component.
-react keeps in synce with the ui and data layer.

-React uses Reconciliation Algorithm also known as React fiber.
-React creates Virtual DOM,that is a representation of Actual DOM.
- To have a view of virtual dom just print the component in console log. It will show a bug structure.
it finds the difference between the new DOm and old, and quickly updates the dom. this is called Diffing Algorithm.
