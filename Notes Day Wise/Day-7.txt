DAY-7-React Routing
-import { createBrowserRouter,RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  { path: "/", element: <Applayout /> },
  { path: "/about", element: <About /> },
]);
root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />);
import { useRouteError } from "react-router";
import { useRouteError } from "react-router";
-useRouteError-hook given by react router
-to catch error we need to provide errorElement
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  { path: "/", element: <Applayout />, errorElement: <Error /> },
  { path: "/about", element: <About /> },
  { path: "/contact", element: <Contact /> },
]);
const Applayout = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Header /> 
      <Outlet /> to replace the different body for differnet pages we use Outlet and according to children pass in approuter it replaces.
    </div>
  );
};
-when we want to router to different page never use <a></a> as it reloads the whole page.
-<Link> should be used.it just changes or refreshs the component.
that is why react is called single page application as on the same page only components are updated.
-Routing is of 2 type
 -CLient Side Routing-where once single file - index.html router through components.
 -Server Side Routing- where the whole new page is loaded example-home.html,about.html
 -for dynamic routing- { path: "/restaurants/:reId", element: <RestaurantMenu /> },
