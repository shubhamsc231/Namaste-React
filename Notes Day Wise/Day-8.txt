Day-8-> Optimisng the app
- if we follow single responsibility principle, which means the code you are writing should be small and crisp.
Custom hook-
hook is a utility or helper function.
-Chunking || Code Spiliting || Dynamic Bundling || lazy loading || on demand loading
-for that we use lazy from react library.
-const Grocery=lazy(()=>{import ('/components/Grocery)}), react is fast so it immediately loads the component.
so we use Suspense in routes with a fallback, so that till the component loads till then a fallback jsx is rendered.
this is how we optimise the application.
