Async and Defer
normal-<script src=""></script>--->
html parsing starts if script tag is encountered then immediatly it fetches the script , then exceute it and then HTML parsing continues.
async - once script is fetched then only the HTML parsing is stopped and script is exceuted.
order is not maintained in async
defer= scripts will be exceuted once the html parsing is completed.
